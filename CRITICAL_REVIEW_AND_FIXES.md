## **Senior Engineer Critical Review**

### **🚨 MAJOR FLAWS IDENTIFIED**

#### **1. Type Safety Theater**

- ❌ **Backend Pydantic models don't match actual return types**
- ❌ **Frontend types are wishful thinking - API returns different structures**
- ❌ **Processing status enum mismatches between frontend/backend**
- ❌ **WiFi status has undocumented fields that break serialization**

#### **2. Error Handling Gaps**

- ❌ **No timeout handling for long-running operations**
- ❌ **SQLite database operations have no connection pooling or retry logic**
- ❌ **File system operations assume permissions always work**
- ❌ **Display driver failures don't have proper fallback chains**

#### **3. Performance & Memory Issues**

- ❌ **Media index loads entire dataset into memory always**
- ❌ **No pagination for large media libraries**
- ❌ **Frame loading doesn't stream - loads entire sequences**
- ❌ **No memory pressure detection or adaptive behavior**

#### **4. Race Conditions Still Exist**

- ❌ **Multiple polling endpoints can trigger simultaneous cache invalidation**
- ❌ **Media index background writer vs immediate writes can conflict**
- ❌ **Upload coordinator + polling can create duplicate processing jobs**

#### **5. Configuration Brittleness**

- ❌ **Hardcoded paths throughout codebase**
- ❌ **No environment-specific config overrides**
- ❌ **Pi-specific hardware assumptions baked into code**
- ❌ **No graceful config migration between versions**

#### **6. Production Deployment Gaps**

- ❌ **No health check endpoints for systemd integration**
- ❌ **No log rotation or disk space monitoring**
- ❌ **No backup/restore functionality for media index**
- ❌ **Missing Pi-specific optimizations (governor, swap, etc.)**

#### **7. Upload Pipeline Fragility**

- ❌ **FFmpeg WebAssembly memory usage can OOM browser**
- ❌ **No chunked upload for large files**
- ❌ **Transaction cleanup timing can cause orphaned workers**
- ❌ **No resume capability for interrupted uploads**

#### **8. Display System Assumptions**

- ❌ **Assumes display hardware is always available**
- ❌ **No detection of display resolution/capabilities**
- ❌ **Message display has no priority system**
- ❌ **Frame rate is hardcoded, not adaptive**
