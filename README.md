## 🔌 Hardware Setup

### What You'll Need

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** or **Raspberry Pi 4** (LOOP's brain!)
- **Waveshare 2.4" ILI9341 LCD** (LOOP's face!)
- **MicroSD card** (8GB+, Class 10)
- **5V USB power** (LOOP gets hungry!)

### Wiring Guide

Connect your display to your Raspberry Pi:

```
LCD Pin  → Pi Pin (BCM)  → Pi Pin (Physical)
VCC      → 3.3V          → Pin 1
GND      → GND           → Pin 6
DIN      → GPIO 10       → Pin 19 (MOSI)
CLK      → GPIO 11       → Pin 23 (SCLK)
CS       → GPIO 8        → Pin 24 (CE0)
DC       → GPIO 25       → Pin 22
RST      → GPIO 27       → Pin 13
BL       → GPIO 18       → Pin 12
```

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Prepare Pi

Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) and enable SSH.

### 2. Install LOOP

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loop.git
cd loop
./deployment/scripts/install.sh
```

The installer will set up everything needed and show you the IP address when ready.

### 3. First Time Setup

1. **Connect to WiFi**:

   - Look for "LOOP-Setup" network (password: loop123)
   - Open any website and configure WiFi via the web interface

2. **Upload Media**:
   - Visit LOOP's web interface
   - Drag and drop your GIFs, videos, and images
   - Watch LOOP bring them to life!

### 4. Updates

Keep LOOP up to date:

```bash
cd /home/pi/loop
git pull
sudo systemctl restart loop
```

## 🎮 Controls

### Web Interface

- **Upload**: Drag & drop files anywhere on the page
- **Play/Pause**: Space bar or click the play button
- **Next/Previous**: Arrow keys or navigation buttons
- **Activate Media**: Click on any media item to play it

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Display Issues?

```bash
# Test LOOP's screen
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "from display.spiout import ILI9341Driver; from config.schema import get_config; d = ILI9341Driver(get_config().display); d.init(); d.fill_screen(0xF800)"
```

### Service Problems?

```bash
sudo systemctl status loop     # Check LOOP status
sudo journalctl -u loop -f     # View logs
sudo systemctl restart loop    # Restart LOOP
```

### WiFi Troubles?

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant  # Reset WiFi
loop-hotspot start                     # Start hotspot mode
```

## 🛠️ Current Limitations

- Physical controls (rotary encoder) are not yet implemented
- Only supports basic media formats (expanding over time)
- Performance depends on Pi model and media complexity
- No advanced video effects or filters

## 🔮 Planned Features

- Physical rotary encoder controls
- More media format support
- Playlist management
- Scheduling and automation
- Mobile app companion
